sequence:

  # pulse sequence type name
  # all names (except 'dummy') are searched in the config file for their specification
  type: dummy # dummy sequence builds N_t times dt_max(1)
  #type: PGSE
  #PGSE:
  # ... # this would contain the parameters for the sequence PGSE

  gamma: 267.5e-6  # rad/ms/mT

  # number of time steps
  N_t: 100

  # time step limit [dt_free, dt_grad]
  dt_max:
    - 1.0 # during gradient-off (free)
    - 0.1 # during gradient-on
